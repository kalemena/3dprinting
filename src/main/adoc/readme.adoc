|=========================================================
|Type |T°C Nozzle |T°C Plate |Speed | Options | Comments

|PLA+ Gray/Green | 210°C | 50°C | 60mm/s | |*EASY*

|PLA+ Carbon Fiber | 215°C | 40°C | 60mm/s | |*GOOD FINISH, not so STRONG*

|PETG+ White/Red | 240°C | 80°C | 60mm/s | 

Enable *coasting*

Reduced *infill speed* to 40mm/s | *VERY GOOD FINISH*

|TPU Transparent | 210°C | 40°C | 25mm/s | |*Flexible!*

== How-to

Generally, steps are as follows:

- identify part you want to print with it's keywords
- measure your part specifics using *digital measuring calliper*
- search link:https://www.thingiverse.com/[thingiverse] or other site for parts keywords, add *parametric* keyword to find SCAD (if any)
- usually, people sharing parts only share STL. + 
STL is fine if you have exact part measures you seek, but a pain if you want to customize the part. + 
Nevertheless, STL often give good advice on part specifics. +
In a wonderful world, people would provide source code, and be using open source and open format ...
- link:https://www.openscad.org/[OpenSCAD] is suitable for programmatic parts creation with basic parts + 
With few experience, pretty advanced figures can be built, without having to learn fancy CAD UI *click-odrome*
- design/program your part with boolean 3D operations
- render *STL* from *openSCAD*
- open in *Cura*, fine tune specifics for your plastic wire (PETG, PLA, etc), and render *GCode* + 
Cura although gives an approximate duration and wire consumption.
- start printing to USB plugged printer
- enjoy printed custom part

.Extrude a few (used when changing wire)
[source,bash]
----
G92 E0 ; set the current filament position to E=0
G1 E50 F200 ; extrude 50mm of filament at speed 200mm/min
