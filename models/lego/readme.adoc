= Lego compatible parts
:hardbreaks:

Lego block lib is based on Thingiverse search.
The lib itself was modified to avoid printing defects, and additional SCAD added. 
Below are custom things.

== Parts

Lego Boost are great, as-is, or when programmed through bluetooth dongle using python lib.
The only mistake from Lego is usage of AAA batteries :-(

Below shows a custom print to replace the 6 AAA by a single LiPo battery.
LiPo battery is a 2S 800mAh, enough for few days of kid playing, while recharging in 30min and obvisouly avoid waste generated by the few AAA sets that are required every few weeks...
Note that recharcheable AAA batteries were tested, without success because voltage is too low, even fully charged.

[TIP]
====
Left: originial
Mid:  3D model
Right:printed model, with LiPo in place
