= Xiaomi Aqara

[IMPORTANT]
====
Xiaomi Aqara Zigbee Sensors are good sensors.

Minimized size factor has drawback to use CR2450 or CR2032 has battaries.
These batteries have short lifespan (~3-12 months).

Changing batteries every short is not good for earth, and ends up costly!

CR123A is a 3.3v battery:
- sized 1/2 AA battery, 
- with x5-10 times energy vs CR2450, so should last more than year
- with low autodrain, 
- has a rechargeable flavor, 
- costs usualy same price vs CR2450/CR2032

CR123A is a good option to save planet/money while not making the sensor too big.
