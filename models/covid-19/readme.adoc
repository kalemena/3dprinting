== Face Shield

These parts are meant to be created using OpenSCAD, from human-readable primitives like spheres, cubes or cylinders.

== Keychain

This is a funny project to create a very randomized COVID figure.

Each refresh in OpenSCAD will generate a distinct figure such as below:

== Drawing 3D

To follow-up on useless random testing, below is 3D generated volumes:
