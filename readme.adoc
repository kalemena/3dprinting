## Material

Up to now, I use only SUNLU wires (from Amazon), so it is not clear if other wires are better or not. +
Sunlu wire is good in all flavors tested below.

.Materials
[width="80%",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|Type |T°C Nozzle |T°C Plate |Speed | Options | Comments

|PLA+ Gray/Green | 210°C | 50°C | 60mm/s | |*EASY*

|PLA+ Carbon Fiber | 215°C | 40°C | 60mm/s | |*GOOD FINISH, not so STRONG*

|PETG+ White/Red | 240°C | 80°C | 60mm/s | 

Enable *coasting*

Reduced *infill speed* to 40mm/s | *VERY GOOD FINISH*

|TPU Transparent | 210°C | 40°C | 25mm/s | |*Flexible!*

## How-to

Generally, steps are as follows:

- identify part you want to print with it's keywords
- measure your part specifics using *digital measuring calliper*
- search link:https://www.thingiverse.com/[thingiverse] or other site for parts keywords, add *parametric* keyword to find SCAD (if any)
- usually, people sharing parts only share STL. + 
STL is fine if you have exact part measures you seek, but a pain if you want to customize the part. + 
Nevertheless, STL often give good advice on part specifics. +
In a wonderful world, people would provide source code, and be using open source and open format ...
- link:https://www.openscad.org/[OpenSCAD] is suitable for programmatic parts creation with basic parts + 
With few experience, pretty advanced figures can be built with need to learn fancy CAD UI *click-odrome*
- design/program your part with boolean 3D operations
- render *STL* from *openSCAD*
- open in *Cura*, fine tune specifics for your wire (PETG, PLA, etc), and render *GCode* + 
Cura although gives an approximate duration and wire consumption.
- open *GCode* in *Repetier*, plug to printer, warm up your wire, calibrate if needed when changing wire or once every 10 prints or when there was big changes in room temperature or humidity. + 
Although Cura can plug and print directly, it seems Repetier gives more stability
- start printing
- enjoy printed custom part
