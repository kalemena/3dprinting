Tooling &amp; Tips for 3d printing

## Printer model

Below is used together with Creality Ender-3 model.

Ender-3 is easy to mount, with ~1h effort.

There are no specific configuration after, because Cura can use "CR-10" defaults, with only changing printer XYZ size.

## Material

Up to now, I use only SUNLU wires (from Amazon), so it is not clear is other wires are better or not.

This wire is good.

## Software

### OpenSCAD

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openscad/releases
$ sudo apt-get install openscad
```

### Cura

Cura engine is probably best tool for slicing.

### Repetier

Repetier Host is nice, includes Cura (although it looks using Cura directly gives better results).

### OctoPrint

Find link here:

## Model

Best place to find model is Thingiverse.

Find few of my models under [sub-folder models](models)
